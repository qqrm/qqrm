## Hello there, I'm Alexey ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I'm a Lead Rust Developer with nearly a decade of experience specializing in backend development, CAD systems, smart contracts, and SORM. My focus is not only on creating complex software architectures and solutions but also on managing and leading development teams.

ðŸŒ± I am eager to further develop my skills in team management and leadership, particularly within tech teams working on complex projects.

ðŸ‘¯ While I am not actively seeking new projects, I am open to considering collaborations in Rust teams or serving as a Rust consultant.

ðŸ¤” I am passionate about sharing knowledge, mentoring, exploring Rust applications, system architecture, and advocating for clean code.

ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about transitioning to Rust, optimizing performance in complex systems, and creating efficient and maintainable architectures.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can contact me via Telegram: [leqqrm.t.me](https://leqqrm.t.me) or email: [qqrm@vivaldi.net](mailto:qqrm@vivaldi.net).

ðŸ˜„ My professional interests extend to leading teams in developing distributed systems, implementing cryptography, and building secure and scalable applications.

âš¡ In my free time, I'm an avid cinema enthusiast, with 2300+ movies and 400+ TV series watched. Check out my full watch history on [Kinopoisk](https://www.kinopoisk.ru/user/13870500/go/). Besides, I enjoy writing poetry, playing the ukulele and guitar, hiking, and indulging in sweet cider. I also collect keyboard smartphones and vinyl records, cherishing the tactile and auditory pleasures they bring.

ðŸŒŸ Fun fact: I use Edge on Arch, btw.
